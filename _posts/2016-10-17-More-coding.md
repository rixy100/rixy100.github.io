    <td>I learnt by persevering even when the tasks felt impossible to do. This was the best strategy because it was possible and if we kept trying we could finish our three task target together.</td>

    <td>I need to work on going through my work before I see if I'm right and the task works. If I do this so the task is fresh in my mind so I can spot the mistake quickly before rather than slowly after.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to fix the task as I am doing it so I can fix the problems quickly instead of going back on it and fixing the task slowly because the task isn't fresh in my mind. I could also be more careful while we are typing in the code.</td>
