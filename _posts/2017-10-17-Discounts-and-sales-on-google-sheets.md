In this week's lesson I managed to fix my discount code and also do a sales page. I also added a delivery cost and VAT. To make the discounts I used book up to look up a percentage on a different page. Then I times that by -1 and I've got my answer. For VAT I just added the rest of the cells up and times it by 0.2.
