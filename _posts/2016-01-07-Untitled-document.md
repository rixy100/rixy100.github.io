In our I.T. lesson we learnt about keeping personal details to our selves such as: our name, where we live, family members, phone numbers and passwords. We keep these details to ourselves because if we didn't we could have people accessing our bank accounts, social media accounts ect. We also helped debugging each others accounts.
