    <td>Today we stopped doing fuze box tasks and learnt about computational thinking (CT). CT is thinking like a computer. I learnt about CT by listening to a powerpoint and then answering questions to do with it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on remembering what I learnt about CT. I can do this by concentrating more so I don't have to go back over my work and correct my mistakes. If I do this I can get through more in lessons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will concentrate to the best of my ability so I can get through more work in class. This will also help me in other lessons for the same reasons if we ever listen to powerpoints or anything like that again. </td>
