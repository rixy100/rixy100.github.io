  <tr>
    <td>The strategies I used to make lots of progress on PygLatin and Functions was to remember what I did in the previous exercise. This helped me when I had to do the finale of the exercises. In the finales you put everything you've learnt so far from the section into one hard question.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on not just remember the things i've done in the section but also things from  the other section. This limited my learning when I forgot how to make a string. If I had remembered this I could have moved a lot faster through the exercises.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve ?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve by trying to remember all the exercises that I have done and not just the one I've just done. This will improve my learning because, I will firstly remember more about Python and I will secondly be able to complete the exercises quicker.</td>
