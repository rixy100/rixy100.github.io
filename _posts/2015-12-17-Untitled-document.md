In our I.T. lesson we learned how to fix our problems on our website such as: posting, title, description and lots more. To fix the problem you go into settings and scroll down until you see a green or yellow coloured slip. If its green everythings fine but, if its yellow it will have writing on to tell you where the problem is. Once youve read that you do what it says and your problem should be fixed.
