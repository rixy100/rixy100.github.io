    <td>In our first lesson back we started to do our new topic google sheets. In the lesson we learnt by watching our teacher code the sheet and then go back to our spots and do it together ourselves. The best way to do it was to listen really carefully so you could do it the quickest.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on concentrating fully to what the teacher is saying. If you didn't concentrate fully you would be stuck when the teacher sent you off to do that piece of work. And then you would be behind the rest of the class.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will improve by concentrating more to what the teacher says. This will help me keep up with the work being set and will help me remember what to do if it came up again. It will also make me have less homework.</td>
