    <td>The strategies I used to get further in the booklet was nearly the same as last time, copying the booklet carefully and solving obvious mistakes. But, this time I also worked with my partner efficiently we did this by one of us reading out the script and the other one typing what the partner said to him.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> My learning was limited because, like last lesson I kept making small mistakes that broke the task. Because I was trying to do the work fast I kept making spelling mistakes that I had to go back and fix.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next, time I will take more time on thinking about little mistakes that break the game. I will also go a bit slower so I don't have to go back and correct my spelling mistakes that I made.</td>
