    <td>To do 3 tasks.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The strategies I used to make lots of progress in the booklet were trial and error and also using my initiative to solve problems that weren't in the booklet. These strategies both worked for me because, you lost nothing if you got it wrong and also you could learn from your mistakes.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on learning from my mistakes so I could get it right next time instead of wasting time on it. If I can do this I will be able to get through the task in the booklet quicker.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to remember the mistakes I made if I come to a problem again. I will also try to use my initiative more so if i come to a new problem I will try to work it out myself.</td>
