    <td>A strategy that was effective was totale it in turns at all the jobs (reading the booklet out to the person typing, typing the code in and finally look for any mistakes in the code being written down). If you did this you would be the most efficient.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on not getting distracted by something on the computer or anyone around me. I also need to not chat as much which is the main reason why I didn't manage to do my target to do three tasks in that lesson.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to talk less so I can accomplish my target in the lesson I also need to concentrate on my own work not anyone else's work or anyone else. If I do this I can do my target next time.</td>
