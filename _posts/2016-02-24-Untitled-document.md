1. Creating my identity map not too hard because all the question were about us.

2. I felt fine about sharing my map because there wasn't anything embarrassing on it.

3. While I was commenting on the identity maps I felt that I shouldn't be mean.

4. I prefered this process because it was anonymous.

5. I liked reading back my comments and I didn't have any surprising comments on my identity map.

6. It's different because most people act nicer when the person can see that they did what they did.

7. It didn't make a sense of what I would like to post more or less of in the future.

8. I don't have any changes I want to make in future based on this activity.

9. The six lessons did change my view on social media in how it's really hard to be private.

10. The six lesson did change how I will use social media. I will use it more privately.
