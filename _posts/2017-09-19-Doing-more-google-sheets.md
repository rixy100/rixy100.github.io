This lesson we carried on with our google sheets work. We learnt how to add a percentage to a number and we also learnt how to efficiently sum numbers. You add a percentage by putting the code of the box and then repeat and then the percentage box with dollar signs. For example, A3+A3*$D$1. And you sum by using the shortcut and then dragging the code down.
