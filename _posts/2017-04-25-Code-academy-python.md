    <td>I learnt by correcting my mistakes. This was very useful as next time when we carry on from where we left off, I can remember the mistakes I made and therefore be able to move through the tasks quicker than I would off.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was that I hadn't done python coding before. I was also limited because, I also kept asking for help from the person sitting next to me which also slowed me down.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and work it out for myself instead of straight away asking the person sitting next to me. I will also use the mistakes I made to get through the work quicker and to remember the work better.</td>
