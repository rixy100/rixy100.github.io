    <td>I learnt by being given clues by my teacher and having to work out the rest. We had learnt the website that we should use at the start of the year (http://www.w3schools.com/). That website tells you all about css, HTML, JavaScript etc.</td>

    <td>I need to work on working the rest of the parts out myself instead of getting the answer given to me. If I can do this I will remember what I did so if it comes up next time I will know what to do.</td>
