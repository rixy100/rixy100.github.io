  <tr>
    <td>The two factors that limited my learning was my lack of general knowledge on the concept and my persistent question asking.
My lack of knowledge limited my learning because it forced me to ask questions about things that should be obvious, my question asking then made it  difficult to learn for myself.  </td>
