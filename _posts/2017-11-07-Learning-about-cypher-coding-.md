In our first lesson back from half term we started our new type of coding for the term, which is cypher. Cypher is we you change code from a normal message to a coded one. For example if my word was 'and' and my code was one letter down for the original one my code word would be ‘boe’. We did this by using the code ‘vlookup’.
