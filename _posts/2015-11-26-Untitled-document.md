In the I.T lesson we made our github accounts and our own websites. We did this by going on the github website and signing up by putting our email addreses in and our new website's username and password. Once we had made our account we had to download an app so we could post things like this. Next we had to make a post to make sure we knew how to post properly.That's what we did in our I.T. lesson to make this.
