    <td>The strategies I used to make lots of progress on python was to make sure I was doing everything right and if I wasn't I would go over it again. This helped me when I made a function and forgot the colon.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To help me learn I need to work on being more precise about what I do. This will help me because, I will be able to move through the exercises quicker and I will also remember how to do the task better.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve?</td>

    <td>Next time I will improve by checking my work to look for any obvious mistakes as I go on. This will help me improve because, if I can recognize my mistakes I will know not to do them again.</td>
