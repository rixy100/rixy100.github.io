    <td>Last lesson we learnt about CT (computational thinking) so we missed out on doing some more fuse box tasks. Which meant that we had to work even faster this lesson. So what we did was make ourselves useful at all times instead of just watching. We kept swapping around the rolls and we ended up doing a big task. </td>

    <td>Even though we worked really hard by the end of lesson I thought we could of done one more task as it wasn't that big. We were about to start it but then we had to pack up just before we were about to make a new script to put the code on.</td>
