In our I.T. we ordered some social media examples from what we though was the safest to the most risky. For example posting a picture of a brothers/sisters birthday party is not very risky but saying your house is going to be empty because you're going on holiday for a week is very risky. We also make ten positive rules for social media and they are:

Positive rules for social media

* Be positive to other people no matter if you like them or not.

* Be friendly don't be mean.

* Have fun with the computers and your friends.

* Make new friends in class and online.

* Use the computers in a positive way.

* Learn new things on the computers and in lessons.

* Get a better knowledge about the world.

* Get inspired by people online.

* Try new things on the computers.

* Post pics and blogs of moments that you enjoy (as long as you don't share where you are).
