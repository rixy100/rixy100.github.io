**Equality Survey**

In our last I.T. lesson we did an equality survey. The equality survey was about things like: do you think the school does enough about bullying? Have you experienced/seen any happen?

I think that the school does do enough about bullying but, they could still do more. I think that they need to be firmer about bullying.
