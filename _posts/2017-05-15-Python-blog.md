  <tr>
    <td>The strategies I used to make lots of progress on python was to remember what I had already previously done and use that to complete the task. This was very helpful as if I forgot how to do something I would take a lot longer on task.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on thinking about the task more than just putting the first thing I think of and jumping to conclusions. This was very annoying when I forgot how to make a variable, I was stuck in it for ages until I found the answer.

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to remember things from previous tasks so I can use them to do the harder tasks. This will help me complete Python quicker. I will also think about the task more so I don't make as many mistakes and therefore do them even quicker than if I did the first thing I thought of.</td>
