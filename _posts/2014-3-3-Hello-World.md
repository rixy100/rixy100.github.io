title: The I.T. lesson
In the I.T. lesson we changed the backgrond colour and the title colour. We did this by going into our editing page in GitHub. Once we had done this we went into the code and changed the colour to whatever we wanted, but we did have to do it in a code language. That was what we did in the I.T. lesson.
