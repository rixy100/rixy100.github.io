In this week's lesson we learnt how to code our work to be able to pick out an individual letter by using left to right code. To do it you have to put left 1 to get the first letter and the from the right how many letters there are. Then it picks out the exact letter. We also learnt how to use len. Len measures how many characters are in a word or sentence.
