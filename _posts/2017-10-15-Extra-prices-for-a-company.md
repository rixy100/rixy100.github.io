In this week's lesson we talked about what extra expenses a company will have to spend. We came up with ones like salary VAT, insurance and utilities. After we had come up with the list, we worked on our first expense, salary. To code the wages you had to times the hours worked by the money they were earning per hour. For example if cashiers were on 8 pounds an hour and they worked 7 hours they would earn 56 pounds.
