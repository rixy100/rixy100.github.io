  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by copying the booklet carefully. So I didn't miss out a space or put the collons in different places to where it’s meant to be. Also if you had copied the code down as the booklet said and it still wasn’t working then you could try and spot what you have done wrong by looking for obvious error.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was that I kept making small mistakes that made the task not work. For example I kept missing out a space or putting an equals sign that’s not meant to be there.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve by thinking before I type something instead of just doing it and then making a mistake that breaks the task. I will also try to copying the booklet accurately so I won’t make a mistake as much as I was.</td>
