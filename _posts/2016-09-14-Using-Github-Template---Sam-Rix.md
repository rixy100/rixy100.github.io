    <td>While we were setting up the fuze box the best way to figure it out was trial and error this was the best way to set it up because you didn't loose anything if you failed and you would eventually manage to figure it out.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Even though I knew trail and error was the best way to set it up I thought I might break it if I did use this method even though that wouldn't happen. So I asked people instead which isn't a very good method.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to use trial and error so I can finish it quicker. I will also try to try every possibility before asking for help. And finally I will not be scared to play around with the fuze box.</td>
