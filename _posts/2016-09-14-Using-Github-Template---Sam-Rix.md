  <tr>
    <td>The strategies I used to get further in the booklet was nearly the same as last time trial and error. This was the best strategy because, if it didn't work you could try something else until you find a way that work. To do the most amount of work we shared roles so two would read the booklet to the one who was typing the code into the fuse box.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on being more specific when reading out the code and typing the code into the fuse box. I need to be more specific when reading out the code so the person typing it into the fuse box won't have to go back to fix the mistake he made because I wasn't clear enough. And I need to be specific when typing in the code so I don't make mistakes that I have to go back on.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve by concentrating more so I don't make mistakes when reading out the code to my partner or when I'm typing in the code into the fuse box. If I can do this I think I might be able to do four tasks.</td>
