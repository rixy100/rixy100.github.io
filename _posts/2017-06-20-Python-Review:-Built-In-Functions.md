    <td>The strategies I used to make lots of progress on python and to get up to Review: Built-In Functions were, to take my time and think about what I was writing instead of rushing in and then getting stuck on it for a long time. And if I still got it wrong the first time after thinking about it for a while I would delete it all and start again.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The habits I need to work on are thinking more about the task I have just done. This will really help when I am doing a harder task and I can't just try and do it as fast as I can and then get it wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve ?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve by, taking my time on task and not just doing it as fast as I can. I will also go back to an exercise if I forget what to do. This will help me do the exercise quicker, it will also reinforce the work I have just done.</td>
