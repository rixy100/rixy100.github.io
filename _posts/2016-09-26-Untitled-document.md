    <td>I learn by using trial and error to set up the fuse box. This was the best tactic because, if it didn't work it wouldn’t break it or do anything like that it would just make you have to try another way.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on not being afraid to use trial and error so i don’t have to ask other people for help and can just do it myself. I also didn’t think about what I should do next that much and just did it which made me slower at setting it up.</td>

    <td>Next, time I will not be afraid to use trial and error so I can learn how to do it myself instead of relying on other people. I will also think more about the next thing I do so I can finish the task quicker.</td>
