This week we carried on with our code academy work on python. I learnt about using a '**'. You used two star in between two numbers as an indices. For example, 3 **6 would be 3x3x3x3x3x3. This was very useful when I had to make by timesing two numbers together 100, so I did 10 ** 2.

I also learnt that one star between two numbers means for the two numbers to be multiplied by each other. For example, if I wanted to make the number 18 you would put into python, 6 * 3. To multiply and put indices in you have to leave spaces between the numbers and star/stars when you write the code.

Here are some of the badges I have earnt on code academy.
